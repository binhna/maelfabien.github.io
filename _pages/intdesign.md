Alright, I get it. This is one of the weird hobbies of mine. I'd say that my girldriend was a good contributor to it, but since we bought a house together, I though that publishing some pictures of the design/renovation of these places would be interesting.

It's an ongoing work, so I'll post pictures later on :)
