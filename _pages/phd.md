In March 2020, I started my Ph.D. in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, affiliated to EPFL. I tried to document the process, whether by describing technical concepts, or simply by writing about some projects, describing a typical day...

I'm working on [Roxanne European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/). ROXANNE (Real time network, text, and speaker analytics for combating organized crime) is an EU funded collaborative research and innovation project, aiming to unmask criminal networks and their members as well as to reveal the true identity of perpetrators by combining the capabilities of speech/language technologies and visual analysis with network analysis.

You'll find below articles that I wrote on topics related to my Ph.D.

# Papers

[Fundamental papers in Speaker Verification](https://maelfabien.github.io/signal/papers_speech) : A list of fundamentals papers in Speaker Verification.

# Maths and stats

[Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and QDA](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/LDA/) : In this article, we'll cover the intuition behind LDA, when it should be used, and the maths behind it. We'll also quick cover the Quadratic version of LDA.

[Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/PLDA/) : Coming soon.

# Kaldi

[Introduction to Kaldi](https://maelfabien.github.io/signal/kaldi/): An introduction to install, understand the key features, the organization, and get you started with Kaldi.

[Kaldi for speaker verification](https://maelfabien.github.io/signal/kaldi2/): An example on how to run Kaldi for speaker verification.


# Voice Processing Fundamentals

[Introduction to Voice Processing in Python](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech8/#): Summary of the book "Voice Computing with Python" with concepts, code and examples.

[Sound Feature Extraction](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech9/#): An overview with a Python implementation of the different sound features to extract.

[Sound Visualization](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech10/#): Dive into spectrograms, chromagrams, tempograms, spectral power density and more...

# Speaker Verification fundamentals

Coming soon

# Text-independent Speaker Verification

[Speaker Verification using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-UBM)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech1/): Speaker biometrics is a field of Speech processing which focuses on identifying a unique speaker from several audio recorings. This can be useful for access control or suspect identification for example.

[Speaker Verification using SVM-based methods](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech2/#): Another method relying on Support Vector Machines for Speaker Verification.
