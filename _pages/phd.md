In March 2020, I started my Ph.D. in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, affiliated to EPFL. I tried to document the process, whether by describing technical concepts, or simply by writing about some projects, describing a typical day...

I'm working on [Roxanne European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/). ROXANNE (Real time network, text, and speaker analytics for combating organized crime) is an EU funded collaborative research and innovation project, aiming to unmask criminal networks and their members as well as to reveal the true identity of perpetrators by combining the capabilities of speech/language technologies and visual analysis with network analysis.

You can learn more about the ROXANNE Project in the article I wrote on it [here](https://maelfabien.github.io/phd2).

You'll find below articles that I wrote on topics related to my Ph.D.
