In March 2020, I started my Ph.D. in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, affiliated to EPFL. I tried to document the process, whether by describing technical concepts, or simply by writing about some projects, describing a typical day...

I'm working on [Roxanne European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/). ROXANNE (Real time network, text, and speaker analytics for combating organized crime) is an EU funded collaborative research and innovation project, aiming to unmask criminal networks and their members as well as to reveal the true identity of perpetrators by combining the capabilities of speech/language technologies and visual analysis with network analysis.

You'll find below articles that I wrote on topics related to my Ph.D.

Its more than 20 members (faculty, research staff, PhD students and support) are world renowned experts in the fields of speaker and language identification, speech recognition, and keyword spotting. The best phone recognition system in the world, and excellent results in NIST Language Recognition and Speaker Recognition Evaluations are among its main achievements. The group is also known for its work in feature extraction and acoustic modeling for speech recognition (features based on neural networks, discriminative training and transforms). <br><br>BUT will bring its experience in speech data collection and speech data mining. It will build on its significant track in EC-sponsored projects, ranging from speech corpora collection (SpeechDat-E, SpeeCon), through audiovisual meeting recognition and processing (M4, AMI, AMIDA) to mobile biometric identification (MOBIO), recognition of rare events both at the level of basic research (DIRAC) and industrial security applications (CareTaker), and aviation safety (A-PiMod). <strong><br></strong></p>

<p>Saarland University is part of the Saarland Informatics Campus, one of the leading locations for Informatics in Germany and Europe with ca. 800 researchers. In the Department of Language Science and Technology, ten research groups work on statistical natural language processing, parsing, semantics, speech recognition, speech synthesis, data analytics, psycholinguistics and dialogue management. The Spoken Language Systems group (LSV) has a long-standing experience in natural language processing, in particular in language modelling, question answering systems and information extraction. Its relation extraction system RelationFactory has scored first in the NIST benchmark on knowledge base population. LSV has participated in major projects like VerbMobil (speech-to-speech translation), SmartKom (multimodal HCI), AMI/AMIDA (multiparty design meetings), D-BOX (interactive gaming applications) and Metalogue (dialogue systems for training metacognitive skills). At the moment its members are part of several national and international projects including COMPRISE (privacy-preserving machine learning), M-Phasis (hate speech detection), ATCO2 (information extraction) and the CRC 1102 on Information Density and Linguistic Encoding.</p>

Transcrime employs an integrated approach (criminology, law, economics, statistics, sociology, forensic accounting) and performs applied research to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse crime (organised crime, economic crime, money laundering, illegal markets, urban crime);</li>
<li>Evaluate of crime prevention policies;</li>
<li>Analyse and identify of criminogenic opportunities in legislation (crime proofing analysis);</li>
<li>Develop risk assessment models and crime prevention strategies for public (e.g. law enforcement, public entities) and private actors (e.g. banks, professionals, companies).</li>
</ul>
<p>Transcrime is a key supporting body of the education activities provided by the Università Cattolica.

[Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and QDA](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/LDA/) : In this article, we'll cover the intuition behind LDA, when it should be used, and the maths behind it. We'll also quick cover the Quadratic version of LDA.

[Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/PLDA/) : Coming soon.

# Kaldi

[Introduction to Kaldi](https://maelfabien.github.io/signal/kaldi/): An introduction to install, understand the key features, the organization, and get you started with Kaldi.

[Kaldi for speaker verification](https://maelfabien.github.io/signal/kaldi2/): An example on how to run Kaldi for speaker verification.


# Voice Processing Fundamentals

[Introduction to Voice Processing in Python](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech8/#): Summary of the book "Voice Computing with Python" with concepts, code and examples.

[Sound Feature Extraction](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech9/#): An overview with a Python implementation of the different sound features to extract.

[Sound Visualization](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech10/#): Dive into spectrograms, chromagrams, tempograms, spectral power density and more...

# Speaker Verification fundamentals

Coming soon

# Text-independent Speaker Verification

[Speaker Verification using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-UBM)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech1/): Speaker biometrics is a field of Speech processing which focuses on identifying a unique speaker from several audio recorings. This can be useful for access control or suspect identification for example.

[Speaker Verification using SVM-based methods](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech2/#): Another method relying on Support Vector Machines for Speaker Verification.
