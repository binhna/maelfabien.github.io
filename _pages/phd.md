In March 2020, I started my Ph.D. in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, affiliated to EPFL. I tried to document the process, whether by describing technical concepts, or simply by writing about some projects, describing a typical day...

I'm working on [Roxanne European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/). The aim of the project is to build graphs to detect criminal activities through voice. I'm focusing on the speaker verification task.

[Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and QDA](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/LDA/) : In this article, we'll cover the intuition behind LDA, when it should be used, and the maths behind it. We'll also quick cover the Quadratic version of LDA.

[Introduction to Voice Processing in Python (1/3)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech8/#): Summary of the book "Voice Computing with Python" with concepts, code and examples.

[Sound Feature Extraction (2/3)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech9/#): An overview with a Python implementation of the different sound features to extract.

[Sound Visualization (3/3)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech10/#): Dive into spectrograms, chromagrams, tempograms, spectral power density and more...

[Speaker Verification using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-UBM)](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech1/): Speaker biometrics is a field of Speech processing which focuses on identifying a unique speaker from several audio recorings. This can be useful for access control or suspect identification for example.

[Speaker Verification using SVM-based methods](https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/Speech2/#): Another method relying on Support Vector Machines for Speaker Verification.
